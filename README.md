##Overview of Project
###Purpose

The most recent stock analysis project aimed to allow Steve to collect information on all stocks over 2017 and 2018. The information provided will assist in deciding which stocks his parents should consider for investment. There were some limitations in accessing all the data in the previous dataset provided, but by refactoring the original code, we can now offer more efficiency in the analysis.
